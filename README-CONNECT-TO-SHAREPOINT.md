# SharePoint Integration Approaches for AI Agents: Custom OBO vs Azure AI Foundry Connector

## Executive Summary

You have two excellent options for integrating SharePoint data with your Supplemental Pay AI Agent. This document compares both approaches and provides implementation guidance for your specific use case.

## Approach Comparison

### Option 1: Custom OBO Flow Implementation (Your Current Project)

**What it is:** A custom-built solution using Microsoft Graph API with On-Behalf-Of (OBO) authentication flow, implemented with Next.js frontend and Python FastAPI backend.

**Technology Stack:**
- Microsoft Entra ID authentication with OBO flow
- Python FastAPI backend with Microsoft Graph API integration
- Next.js frontend with MSAL authentication
- Direct API calls to SharePoint via Microsoft Graph

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Full control over data access and processing
- ✅ Custom business logic implementation
- ✅ Direct access to SharePoint files, lists, and metadata
- ✅ Real-time data access
- ✅ Custom error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Integration with multiple Microsoft services (Teams, Calendar, Mail)
- ✅ Production-ready with comprehensive logging

**Requirements:**
- Azure App Registration with proper permissions
- Developer expertise in Microsoft Graph API
- Custom infrastructure management
- Token management and refresh logic

### Option 2: Azure AI Foundry SharePoint Connector (Microsoft's New Solution)

**What it is:** Microsoft's out-of-the-box SharePoint connector for Azure AI Agent Service, leveraging the same technology that powers Microsoft 365 Copilot.

**Technology Stack:**
- Azure AI Agent Service
- Microsoft 365 Copilot API
- Built-in indexing and chunking capabilities
- Enterprise-grade retrieval stack

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Zero-code SharePoint integration
- ✅ Built-in intelligent indexing and chunking
- ✅ Advanced query processing
- ✅ Automatic content refresh logic
- ✅ Enterprise-grade security and governance
- ✅ Identity Passthrough/OBO authentication built-in
- ✅ Same technology powering Microsoft 365 Copilot
- ✅ Automatic document processing and semantic search

**Requirements:**
- Microsoft 365 Copilot License (per user/developer)
- Azure AI Agent Service access
- Limited customization options

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Current OBO Project Enhancement

Your existing project already provides:
- ✅ SharePoint sites and lists access
- ✅ File content extraction (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, PDF)
- ✅ Search capabilities
- ✅ Document libraries integration
- ✅ User context preservation

**To extend for your AI Agent:**

```python
# Add to your existing main.py
@app.get("/api/ai-agent/search-documents")
async def search_supplemental_pay_documents(
    query: str, 
    country_code: str = None,
    document_type: str = None,
    token: str = Depends(get_bearer_token)
):
    """Search SharePoint documents for Supplemental Pay information"""
    # Use your existing OBO flow
    graph_token = await exchange_token_via_obo(token, [
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/Sites.Read.All",
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/Files.Read.All"
    ])
    
    # Custom search logic for policy documents
    search_results = await search_policy_documents(
        graph_token, query, country_code, document_type
    )
    
    return {
        "results": search_results,
        "agent_context": "supplemental_pay_policies",
        "country_filter": country_code
    }
```

### Azure AI Foundry Integration

If you choose the hybrid approach:

```python
# New connector for AI Foundry
from azure.ai.agent import SharePointConnector

class SupplementalPayAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Azure AI Foundry for SharePoint
        self.sharepoint_connector = SharePointConnector(
            sites=["policy-central", "hr-documents"],
            folders=["supplemental-pay-policies", "country-specific"]
        )
        
        # Custom OBO for other systems
        self.databricks_connector = CustomDataBricksConnector()
        self.servicenow_connector = CustomServiceNowConnector()
    
    async def query_policies(self, query: str, country: str):
        # Get SharePoint data via Foundry
        sharepoint_results = await self.sharepoint_connector.search(
            query=f"{query} country:{country}",
            include_content=True
        )
        
        # Get structured data via custom connectors
        databricks_data = await self.databricks_connector.query(
            country=country, policy_type="supplemental_pay"
        )
        
        return {
            "documents": sharepoint_results,
            "structured_data": databricks_data
        }
```

## Cost Analysis

### Custom OBO Implementation
- **Development**: 160-320 hours @ $100-150/hour = $16K-48K
- **Azure Infrastructure**: $200-500/month
- **Maintenance**: 20-40 hours/month = $2K-6K/month
- **Total Year 1**: $40K-120K

### Azure AI Foundry Connector
- **Copilot Licenses**: $30/user/month × users = Variable
- **Azure AI Service**: $500-2000/month (usage-based)
- **Development**: 40-80 hours = $4K-12K
- **Total Year 1**: $10K-30K + license costs

### Hybrid Approach
